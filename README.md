# Windows System Programming
This repository contains a few system applications. These are based on the Windows Kernel Programming of
Pavel Yosifovich with some personal modifications here and there.
You can find both userland and kerneland (drivers) examples.
If I am motivated enough, I will add the same kind of stuff for Linux and Solaris. (BSD kerneland is not
yet a string on my bow.)
